FlappyBlock
===========

This probably will be our entry to the [Mini LD 52 - Retro Challenge](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/06/02/mini-ld-52-the-retro-challenge/ "Mini LD 52").

"Probably", because we don't know if we'll have time to finish it - The goal is to create a game for an ancient architecture, and we choose to make a Flappy Bird-like game for the Atari 2600. We will have only 10 days to create something playable and this is a tight schedule for a game fully programmed in assembly.

The game
========

The game is a Flappy Bird clone using only blocks.
